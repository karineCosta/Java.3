Java Exercises – Recursion, Composition, and Inheritance

This repository contains a set of Java programming exercises focused on recursion, class composition, and inheritance. 
These exercises were developed as part of my university coursework to deepen my understanding of object-oriented programming and algorithmic thinking in Java.
🧠 Topics Covered

    Recursion with arrays and strings

    Finding minimum values using recursion

    Composition vs inheritance

    Class hierarchies and polymorphism

    Working with coordinates and geometry

📋 Exercise Descriptions

    Print Integer Array Recursively
    A recursive method printArray that prints all elements of an integer array, separated by spaces.

    Print Character Array in Reverse
    A recursive method stringInverse that takes a character array containing a string and prints it in reverse order.

    Find the Minimum in an Integer Array
    A recursive method minimoRecursive that finds and returns the smallest element in an integer array. The method stops when it receives an array with a single element.

    Use Composition Instead of Inheritance
    Refactor the BasePlusCommissionEmployee class to use composition instead of inheritance with the CommissionEmployee class. Demonstrates how composition can offer the same functionality as inheritance with more flexibility.

    Quadrilateral Inheritance Hierarchy
    Implementation of a class hierarchy for geometric shapes:

        Quadrilateral (base class with x-y coordinates)

        Trapezoid

        Parallelogram

        Rectangle

        Square
        Also includes a Point class to represent coordinate pairs. Each class calculates the area of the shape, with deeper inheritance to model real-world shape relationships.

🛠️ Technologies

    Java 17+

    IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code


📚 Learning Objectives

These exercises helped me:

    Understand recursive thinking and problem decomposition.

    Learn how to model real-world relationships using inheritance.

    Refactor code to improve maintainability using composition.

    Practice encapsulation and class design using Java.
